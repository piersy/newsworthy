Perhaps also by the Warsaw ghetto uprising in May. This reaction was pretty standard for Himmler,\u201d said Evans.\n\nHowever Evans, an international specialist on German history, said it was not entirely certain if the SS chief was told about the Treblinka uprising until late August.\n\nHeinrich Himmler was one of the architects of the Holocaust.

A separate letter, dated 15 September 1943, reveals that another SS officer \u2013 Obergruppenf\u00fchrer Oswald Pohl \u2013 informed Himmler\u2019s adjutant, Rudolf Brandt, that all paperwork relating to the order to kill on Alderney had been destroyed.\n\n\u201cThere is no longer any written material on this subject in existence,\u201d states the letter, also marked top secret.\n\nYet Himmler\u2019s letter somehow survived, and after likely being looted from SS headquarters following the war, was acquired at a New York auction in June 1983 by Sayer.\n\nThe 78-year-old is known for tracking down stolen Nazi gold and war criminals as well as being a leading authority on the verification of wartime documents, but felt uncomfortable supplying them to the government\u2019s review.\n\n\u201cAs a person who has assisted various societies, museums, authors, and journalists over many years, by providing copies of documents, and letters from my second world war archive, I thought I could make a contribution,\u201d said Sayer, who in 1988 tracked down the world\u2019s most senior surviving Nazi, SS General Wilhelm Mohnke.\n\nSayer believes the government\u2019s instructions for public submissions will deter members of the public wanting to help, particularly the threat from the inquiry that documents not supplied in a certain format \u201cwill be disregarded\u201d.\n\nDescribing the SS documents as of \u201cconsiderable historical significance\u201d Sayer added: \u201cThe inquiry itself is a worthy cause but it is not right to treat people you are asking for help in this way.\u201d\n\nProfessor Robert Jan Van Pelt of Canada\u2019s University of Waterloo, a leading expert on Auschwitz, corroborated the authenticity of the documents, concluding they were \u201cundoubtedly genuine.\u201d\n\nPelt, who was an expert witness in the London trial of Holocaust-denier David Irving is also currently on the expert panel of the Alderney inquiry led by Pickles.\n\nThe same set of documents collected by Sayer reveal insights into the SS construction brigade charged with building up the Nazi\u2019s defences on Alderney, with one passage applauding the work ethic of the enslaved labourers, saying \u201cthe prisoners\u2019 productivity equalled that of German workers\u201d."}}, "key_message": "Previously unpublished documents reveal that Heinrich Himmler, a key architect of the Holocaust, gave secret orders to murder up to 1,000 enslaved labourers on the British island of Alderney during WWII, with evidence suggesting that the actual death toll may be higher than officially recorded.", "tags": ["Europe", "History", "Crime"], "neutrality": 0.9}
